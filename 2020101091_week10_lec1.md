# Week 9 - lecture 2

# Introduction:

In this lecture , we continued our discussion on NP-complete problems and saw some examples of how we can convert a problem to an NP- complete problem since to prove that a problem is in NP- complete , we need to show that the problem is in NP and show that there is a way to reduce 3-SAT to the problem .

The two problems that we looked at were :

- Vertex Cover Problem
- Subset Sum problem

# Vertex Cover Problem :

If we have a un-directed graph G , then vertex cover of G is a subset of nodes where every edge of G touches at least one of those nodes.

In this problem , we are asked whether the graph contains a vertex cover of a specific size. 

To show this problem is NP-complete, we will reduce the 3-SAT problem to the vertex cover problem in polynomial time . 

We will map a boolean formula (phi) to the graph G and the value k (size of vertex cover) .

- We create an edge linking two nodes for each variable x in phi and label the two nodes as x and x'. Now we map x to "true" meaning it corresponds to selecting the left node for the vertex cover while x' to "false" meaning it corresponds to the right node .
- Consider a triple of three nodes, each labelled with one of the clause's three literals. These three nodes are linked to each other as well as to the nodes in the variable gadgets with the same labels. As a result, the total number of nodes in G is $2m+3l$, with phi having m variables and l clauses. Now we assume that k is $m+2l$ .
- Now we prove that this reduction will work only if G has a vertex cover with k nodes .
- In the vertex cover, we first place the nodes of the variable gadgets that correspond to the true literals in the assignment. Then, for each phrase, we choose one true literal and place the remaining two nodes from each clause gadget into the vertex cover. There are now k nodes in total. Because every variable gadget edge is clearly covered, all three edges within each clause gadget are covered, and all edges between variable and clause gadgets are covered, they cover all edges. As a result, G has a k-node vertex cover.
- To cover the edges of the variable gadgets and the three edges within the clause gadgets, the vertex cover must have one node in each variable gadget and two in each clause gadget. There are no more nodes. Assign "True" to the nodes of the variable gadgets that are in the vertex cover. This assignment fulfils the requirements of phi.
- Hence one of the edges must be covered by a node from a variable and hence we are able to reduce the vertex cover problem to 3-SAT.

# Subset Sum Problem :

Given an array of non-negative integers, and a value *sum*, determine if there is a subset of the given set with sum equal to given *sum*.

To show this problem is NP-complete , we again try to convert this problem to the 3-SAT problem in polynomial time .

- Consider the 3 cnf-formula. If and only if phi is satisfiable, we construct an instance of the Subset Sum Problem with a sub collection summing to the target t. T will be the name of the sub collection.
- Let phi be a Boolean formula with x_1,...,x_l variables and clauses c_1,...,c_k. The reduction turns phi into a Subset Sum Problem instance (S, t).
- We can draw a few conclusions if we build a table and partially fill it with sample sentences. For each variable xi in phi, we can see that S contains one pair of numbers, y_i, z_i. There are two portions to the decimal representation of these numerals. A one is followed by
    
    (l - i) 0's on the left. Each clause is represented by a single digit on the right, with the j'th digit of y_i equalling 1 if clause c_j includes literal x_i and the j'th digit of z_i equalling 1 if clause c_j contains literal x'i. The digits that aren't defined as 1 are set to 0. 
    
    For each c_j, S also contains a pair of numbers g_j, h_j. These two numbers are equal and are made up of a 1 and (k - j) 0's. The target number t, which corresponds to the bottom row of the table, is made up of i 1's and k 3's.
    
    Let's pretend that phi is satisfiable. The following procedure can be used to create a subset of S. If xi is assigned "True" in the satisfying assignment, we choose y_i, and if xi is assigned "False," we choose z_i. When we add up everything we've chosen thus far, we get a 1 in the first l digits. Furthermore, because each phrase is met and hence contains between 1 and 3 literals, the last k digits are between 1 and 3. We must now choose enough g and h values to get the last k digits to three.
    
    Suppose a subset of S sums to t. We can construct a satisfying assignment to phi after making several observations.
    
    1. All the digits in members of S are either 0 or 1.
    2. The table describing S has a maximum of 5 1's in each column. As a result, when a subset of S is added, there is never a "carry" into the following column. The subset must have either y or z for each I but not both, to produce a 1 in each of the first l columns.
        
        
        Now it's time to complete the enjoyable task. We assign "True" to xi if the subset contains y_i, else "False." Because each of the final k columns has total 3, this assignment always satisfies phi. At most two can come from g_j and h_j in column c_j, hence at least one must come from one of the subset's y_i or z_i. If it's z_i, x'i will show up in c_j, and xi will be marked as "False." If y_i, xi is assigned "True" in c_j. phi is pleased as a result.
        
        As a result, both the Vertex Cover and Subset Sum issues are NP-complete problems.
