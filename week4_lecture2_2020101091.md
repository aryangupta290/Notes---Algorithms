# Week 4 -Lecture 7

In this lecture we learned about the basic Greedy algorithms , how to solve Activity Selection problem, Huffman coding etc So we discussed the following points:

- How to think about Greedy Algorithms and their solutions.
- What is Activity Selection problem and how to solve it greedily.
- What are Huffman codes and how to solve it Greedily.

# Greedy Algorithms:

These are the algorithms where we solve the problem by making the locally optimal choice at each stage  and then prove that doing so (solving sub-problems) actually gives the best solution for the original 

problems.

## Basic Greedy Design:

The greedy design for such problems usually consists of two steps:

- Greedy choice Property - First we select some element or property that is guaranteed to be present in the optimal solution for the problem.
- Optimal Substructure Property : Here since we have already chosen some element or property , we decide if we can state the rest of the problem as a smaller version of the original problem.

The proof is usually done using Induction.

There are many problems which can be solved using Greedy approach like the Minimum Spanning Tree problem, Activity Selection Problem , Huffman coding problem , etc.

We discussed MST in last class , so let us look at Activity Selection Problem which were discussed in today's class .

# Activity Selection Problem:

In this problem we are given an array(n elements) of pairs consisting of start time and finish time in random order.

We are required to  select maximum number of activities that can be say performed by a single person , that is all chosen activities time frame should be disjoint and there shouldn't be any moment in time where a person is performing more than one job.

## Greedy Choice:

Using the basic Greedy design that we discussed above, let us think how to build a greedy solution for the problem.

- **Greedy Choice** : The first observation we can make out is that the activity with the minimum finish time will be a part of the optimal solution.

### Proof:

Say the activity with minimum finish time is a_0  and the current optimal solution is S . So if a_0 is present in S then we don't need to prove anything .

If a_0 is not part of S , then consider a_k in S which has the minimum finish time.

BY observation we can realise that we can replace a_k by a_0 since a_0 is the global minimum and a_k is only the local minimum.

So since finish time of a_k has to be greater than equal to that of a_0 , we can replace it and see that it does not affect the number of elements in our optimal solution.

- **Optimal substructure** : Given that we have chosen one activity in our solution , we can remove all activities from the set which are non compatible with a_0 , that is all those activities whose time frame are not disjoint with a_0 .

    And from the remaining elements , we can just repeat same algorithm by picking element with minimum finish time and then removing in-compatible elements and we can continue to do this until the set is non-empty. 

    This will gurantee us a solution.
